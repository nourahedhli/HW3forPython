# Homework: Explain Object Oriented Programming Using Python
## Encapsulation

## 
Encapsulation means that there many methods or objects inside a class.
Like here for Example we class addition that has many methods inside of it
and class addition encapsulate these objects. In order to use those methods, we have to call/import those classes to use the methods.

## Abstraction

Abstraction is basically like hiding the manual from the "user". Like for example for if we are using
computer we are only pressing buttons, but we have no idea what is going on in the inside.
So Abstraction is basically calling a class to do something but we do not know
how it is doing it. Like in the example of the Calculator.py we are calling Addition to do sum
by giving it parameters, lets say we didn't creat the class Addition we only know that if
we use it we can do Addition of these two numbers.
